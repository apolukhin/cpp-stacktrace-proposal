<!-- todo: make it like http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0275r0.html -->
## The problem
<!-- motivation: too hard for users -->
<!-- todo: define a problem like: sometimes developers need to view the stack trace. Stack is the ..., stack trace is the...-->
The problem defined is available on this link: (https://stdcpp.ru/proposals/19b28afa-bc73-4d8f-a7c8-c5723b544ecc)
